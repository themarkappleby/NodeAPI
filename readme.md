# API Server

This project is based on this tutorial: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-x6WdwaJco&feature=youtu.be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-x6WdwaJco&feature=youtu.be).

To start the server run `nodemon server.js` from the project root (note - global nodemon install is required).

View the API, to view the API, visit [http://localhost:3000/api/products](http://localhost:3000/api/products).

To interact with the API, use [Chrome Postman](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/postman-rest-client/fdmmgilgnpjigdojojpjoooidkmcomcm?hl=en). When using Postman, make sure that you add the following header: `Content-Type : application/json` (this detail is absent from the tutorial).
